# User Rating System Implementation - Complete

## Overview
The comprehensive user rating system has been successfully implemented with progressive booking restrictions based on user behavior. Users now face escalating restrictions based on their rating, from forced request-only bookings to complete booking bans.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
1. **user_rating_config** - Defines rating tiers and policies
2. **user_rating_history** - Tracks all rating changes with reasons
3. **user_restaurant_blacklist** - Restaurant-specific restrictions
4. **restaurant_rating_requirements** - Custom restaurant requirements

#### Rating Tiers
- **Excellent (4.5-5.0)**: Full instant booking privileges
- **Good (3.5-4.4)**: Request-only bookings but generally accepted
- **Restricted (2.5-3.4)**: Limited access, subject to restaurant approval and restrictions
- **Blocked (1.0-2.4)**: Booking privileges suspended

### Core Functions

#### `calculate_user_rating(user_id)`
Calculates user rating based on:
- **No-shows**: -0.5 points
- **Late cancellations**: -0.2 points (within 2 hours)
- **Completed bookings**: Baseline rating
- **Reviews left**: +0.1 bonus points

#### `update_user_rating(user_id, booking_id, reason)`
Updates user rating and logs the change in history table.

#### `check_booking_eligibility(user_id, restaurant_id, party_size)`
Returns comprehensive eligibility check:
```sql
{
  can_book: boolean,
  forced_policy: 'instant' | 'request_only' | 'blocked',
  restriction_reason: text,
  user_tier: text,
  user_rating: numeric
}
```

#### `get_user_rating_tier(user_rating)`
Returns tier information for a given rating value.

## Frontend Integration

### Hooks

#### `useUserRating(userId?)`
Enhanced hook providing:
- Rating statistics and history
- Booking eligibility checking
- Rating tier information
- Computed helper values (isExcellent, canBookInstant, etc.)

#### `useBookingCreate` (Updated)
- Automatic rating eligibility checks
- Real-time restriction warnings
- Policy enforcement (instant → request conversion)

#### `useBookingConfirmation` (Updated)
- Pre-booking eligibility validation
- Automatic policy adjustment
- User-friendly restriction alerts

### Components

#### `UserRatingDashboard`
Comprehensive rating overview showing:
- Current rating with visual indicator
- Booking privileges status
- Statistics breakdown
- Rating improvement tips
- Recent rating history

#### `RatingIndicator`
Compact rating display component with:
- Color-coded rating status
- Multiple sizes (small, medium, large)
- Optional labels

#### `BookingRestrictionAlert`
Context-aware restriction warnings:
- Blocking alerts for banned users
- Policy change notifications
- Improvement guidance

## Business Logic

### Rating Calculation
```
Base Rating = 5.0
- No-shows: -0.5 per incident
- Late cancellations: -0.2 per incident
+ Review bonus: +0.1 per review
= Final Rating (clamped between 1.0-5.0)
```

### Booking Restrictions
1. **Excellent Users**: No restrictions, instant booking everywhere
2. **Good Users**: Request-only policy enforced
3. **Restricted Users**: 
   - Request-only bookings
   - Some restaurants may reject based on specific criteria
   - Subject to blacklist restrictions
4. **Blocked Users**: Complete booking ban

### Restaurant-Specific Rules
Restaurants can define custom requirements:
- Minimum rating thresholds
- Maximum party size limits
- Special restrictions for certain rating tiers

## Security & Data Integrity

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Rating history visible only to user and admins
- Blacklist entries protected
- Configuration tables admin-only

### Audit Trail
- All rating changes logged with timestamps
- Booking IDs linked to rating changes
- Reason codes for all modifications

### Data Validation
- Rating values constrained to 1.0-5.0 range
- Automatic recalculation prevents manual tampering
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Usage Examples

### Check User's Booking Eligibility
```typescript
const { checkBookingEligibility } = useUserRating();
const eligibility = await checkBookingEligibility(restaurantId);

if (!eligibility.can_book) {
  // Show restriction message
  alert(eligibility.restriction_reason);
}
```

### Display Rating Dashboard
```typescript
<UserRatingDashboard 
  userId={userId} 
  isOwnProfile={true} 
/>
```

### Show Rating Indicator
```typescript
<RatingIndicator 
  userId={userId}
  size="medium"
  showLabel={true}
/>
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Appeal System**: Allow users to contest rating decisions
2. **Rating Recovery Programs**: Structured improvement paths
3. **Restaurant Feedback Integration**: Direct impact on ratings
4. **Tiered Loyalty Benefits**: Rating-based perks and privileges
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed rating trend analysis

### Configuration Options
- Adjustable rating penalties/bonuses
- Customizable tier thresholds
- Restaurant-specific override rules
- Time-based rating decay/recovery

## Testing

### Database Functions Tested
✅ Rating calculation with various scenarios
✅ Tier assignment across all rating ranges
✅ Booking eligibility for all user types
✅ Rating history tracking

### Frontend Integration Tested
✅ Hook integration with database functions
✅ Real-time eligibility checking
✅ Policy enforcement in booking flow

### Edge Cases Handled
✅ New users (default 5.0 rating)
✅ Missing rating data (defaults)
✅ Database errors (graceful fallbacks)
✅ Network failures (cached data)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Indexed rating fields for fast lookups
- Cached tier calculations
- Batched rating updates
- Efficient eligibility queries

### Monitoring
- Rating distribution analytics
- Booking restriction impact metrics
- User behavior correlation tracking
- System performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The user rating system is now fully operational and provides:
- **Comprehensive rating tracking** based on user behavior
- **Progressive restriction enforcement** that scales with rating
- **Transparent user feedback** with improvement guidance
- **Restaurant-specific customization** for flexible policies
- **Robust data integrity** with full audit trails

This implementation ensures that users are incentivized to maintain good booking behavior while providing restaurants with tools to manage their reservation quality effectively.

### 5. ✅ Booking System Integration (`hooks/useBookingCreate.ts`)
- Fraud detection before booking creation
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Eligibility validation with enhanced security
- Security monitoring integration

### 6. ✅ Authentication Security (`context/supabase-provider.tsx`)
- Enhanced sign-in with input validation
- Enhanced sign-up with comprehensive validation
- Device security and fingerprinting
- Rate limiting on auth actions
- Security event monitoring

### 7. ✅ Form Validation Enhancement (`app/sign-up.tsx`)
- Enhanced input validation
- Password strength enforcement
- Phone number format validation
- Email sanitization and validation
- Terms agreement validation
- TypeScript compilation verified ✅

## 🛡️ Security Features Active

### Rate Limiting (Per User)
- **Booking Creation**: 5 per 5 minutes
- **Booking Cancellation**: 10 per hour
- **Review Submission**: 3 per 10 minutes

- **Registration**: 3 per hour
- **Search Requests**: 100 per minute

### Fraud Detection Patterns
- Rapid booking attempts
- Duplicate booking prevention
- High cancellation rate detection
- No-show pattern monitoring
- Suspicious timing analysis

### User Rating & Restriction System
- **Excellent (4.5-5.0)**: Full instant booking privileges
- **Good (3.5-4.4)**: Request-only bookings
- **Restricted (2.5-3.4)**: Limited access
- **Blocked (1.0-2.4)**: Booking privileges suspended

### Device & Account Security
- Device fingerprinting active
- Maximum 3 accounts per device
- Suspicious device monitoring
- Account lockout mechanisms

### Input Security
- XSS prevention active
- SQL injection protection
- Email domain validation
- Phone number sanitization
- Password strength enforcement

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-Time Security Monitoring
- Security events logged in real-time
- Automatic escalation after 5 violations
- Risk level assessment (low/medium/high/critical)
- Progressive warning system

### Audit Trail
- Complete action logging
- User behavior tracking
- Security event correlation
- Compliance reporting ready

## 🔗 Integration Points

### API Security Middleware
All sensitive operations are protected with:
```typescript
withSecurityMiddleware(apiCall, {
  rateLimitKey: userId,
  actionType: "booking_creation",
  requireAuth: true,
  fraudCheck: true,
  validateInput: true,
  monitorFailures: true,
})
```

### Form Validation
Enhanced validation across all user input forms with security-first approach.

### Database Security
Complete RLS policy coverage ensuring data access control at the database level.

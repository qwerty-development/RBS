#### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```
Risk Score = (User Rating Factor) + (Cancellation Rate √ó 0.1) + 
             (No-Show Rate √ó 0.2) + (Fraud Patterns √ó 0.2) + 
             (Security Flags √ó 0.5)
```

  rateLimitKey: userId,
  actionType: "booking_creation",
  requireAuth: true,
  fraudCheck: true,
  validateInput: true,
  monitorFailures: true,
})
```

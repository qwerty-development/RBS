# Add to Calendar Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the "Add to Calendar" functionality using `expo-calendar` which is the recommended approach for Expo projects. The implementation adds restaurant booking details to the user's device calendar with proper reminders.

## What was implemented

### 1. Dependencies
- ✅ `expo-calendar` (v14.1.4) - Already installed in package.json
- ✅ Uses Expo's native calendar integration for better compatibility
- ✅ Removed `react-native-calendar-events` (was causing auto-linking issues in Expo)

### 2. Permissions Configuration

#### iOS (app.json)
- ✅ Added `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` to infoPlist with clear explanation
- ✅ Required for iOS calendar access

#### Android (app.json + AndroidManifest.xml)
- ✅ Added `READ_CALENDAR` and `WRITE_CALENDAR` permissions to app.json
- ✅ Permissions already present in AndroidManifest.xml

### 3. Calendar Functionality

#### Permission Handling
```typescript
const { status } = await Calendar.requestCalendarPermissionsAsync();
if (status !== 'granted') {
  // Handle permission denial gracefully
}
```

#### Event Creation
The function creates a calendar event with:
- **Title**: "Dinner at [Restaurant Name]"
- **Date/Time**: Uses the booking's scheduled time
- **Duration**: Default 2 hours (can be customized)
- **Location**: Restaurant address or name
- **Notes**: Comprehensive details including:
  - Number of guests
  - Confirmation code
  - Special requests
  - Occasion details
  - Restaurant phone number
- **Reminders**: Two alarms set for 1 hour and 30 minutes before (using `relativeOffset`)

#### Error Handling
- Permission denial: Clear message with instructions
- Network/API errors: User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback suggestions

## How it works

1. **User taps "Add to Calendar"** button on confirmed or pending bookings
2. **Permission check** - App requests calendar access using Expo Calendar API
3. **Calendar discovery** - Finds the default calendar on the device
4. **Event creation** - Creates structured event with all booking details using `Calendar.createEventAsync()`
5. **Confirmation** - Success message with reminder details
6. **Error handling** - Clear feedback if something goes wrong

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Copy Confirmation Code
- Implemented clipboard functionality for confirmation codes
- Haptic feedback on successful copy
- User-friendly success message

### 2. Quick Call Function
- Implemented direct restaurant calling
- Proper URL scheme handling for phone calls
- Error handling for unavailable phone numbers

## Button Visibility Logic

The "Add to Calendar" button appears for:
- ✅ **Confirmed bookings** (upcoming)
- ✅ **Pending bookings** (awaiting confirmation)
- ❌ **Past bookings**
- ❌ **Cancelled bookings**
- ❌ **Declined bookings**

## Testing Notes

### To test the implementation:

1. **Device Setup**: Ensure you have a calendar app installed (native Calendar app)
2. **Permissions**: First use will request calendar permissions
3. **Event Verification**: Check your calendar app for the created event
4. **Reminders**: Verify that alarms/notifications are set properly

### Expected Behavior:
- Event appears in default device calendar
- All booking details included in event notes
- Reminders trigger 1 hour and 30 minutes before
- Location can be tapped for directions (if supported by calendar app)

## Files Modified

1. **`components/booking/BookingCard.tsx`**
   - Added `react-native-calendar-events` import
   - Implemented `handleAddToCalendar` function
   - Implemented `handleCopyConfirmation` function  
   - Implemented `handleQuickCall` function

2. **`app.json`**
   - Added iOS calendar permission description
   - Added Android calendar permissions

## Dependencies Used

- `expo-calendar` - Core calendar functionality (Expo's recommended approach)
- `expo-haptics` - Tactile feedback (already used)
- `expo-clipboard` - Copy to clipboard (already used)
- React Native `Alert` and `Linking` - User feedback and phone calls

The implementation is production-ready and follows best practices for error handling, user experience, and Expo development workflows.

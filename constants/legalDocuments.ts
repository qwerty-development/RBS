• Card Guarantee & Charges. If a card guarantee is required, you authorize a pre-authorization and, where applicable, the Late Cancellation/No-Show fee set by the Restaurant (per cover, fixed amount, or percentage), plus applicable taxes/processing. Plate collects such amounts as an agent for the Restaurant.
• Modifications. Changes to date, time, or party size inside the notice period may be treated as a cancellation under the Restaurant's policy.
• No-Show. A No-Show occurs when you fail to arrive or check in within the Restaurant's grace period. Repeated no-shows may limit booking privileges and/or loyalty eligibility.
• How to Cancel. Use "Cancel Reservation" in the app. The effective cancellation time is the timestamp recorded by our system in the Restaurant's local time zone.
